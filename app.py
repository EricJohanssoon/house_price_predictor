"""
Application that predicts heart disease percentage in the population of a town
based on the number of bikers and smokers. 

Trained on the data set of percentage of people biking 
to work each day, the percentage of people smoking, and the percentage of 
people with heart disease in an imaginary sample of 500 towns.
